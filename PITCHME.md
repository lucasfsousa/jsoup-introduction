## What?
`jsoup` is a Java library for processing HTML data:
- scrape and parse HTML data from URL, file or string.
- find and extract data using DOM or CSS selectors.

---

## Why?

- There is no API to get the data
- You don't have access to the API

---

### How?
```
Document document = Jsoup.connect("http://jambit.com").get();
Element h1Image = document.select("h1 img").first();
assertEquals("jambit â€“ Where Innovation Works",
    h1Image.attr("alt"));
```

---

## Problems

- Any change in the structure of the HTML can break the solution
- Your IP can be blocked depending on the site
